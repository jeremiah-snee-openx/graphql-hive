## Hive Proxy Worker

Idea here is to have a proxy worker that can be used to make requests outside GraphQL Hive and without any access to the internal network.
This is very useful for example for making requests to external APIs.

Look at [models.ts](./src/models.ts) to see the structure accepted payload.
