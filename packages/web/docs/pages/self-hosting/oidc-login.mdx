# OIDC Login

By default GraphQL Hive allows you to login using a email and password.
However, you can also enable OIDC (often refered to as social login).
This allows you to login using a third party provider such as GitHub and Google.

## GitHub

First, you need to create a new GitHub application on https://github.com/settings/applications/new

For the `Homepage URL` option full in the web app base URL (e.g. `https://app.graphql-hive.com`).
For the `Authorization callback URL` option use the web app base URL followed by `/auth/callback/github` (e.g. `https://app.graphql-hive.com/auth/callback/github`)`.

Create the app and generate a new client secret.

Then, you need to add the following environment variables for your GraphQL Hive `app` instance:

```bash
AUTH_GITHUB=1
AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=741784e6331a404eaXXX                         # use the one of your app
AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=e43e123dd54de2b56126dc4afc4491dbbba6bXXX # use the you just created
```

Now the Sign Up with GitHub button should be visible on the login page.

## Google

First, you need to create a new Google OIDC application following this guide: https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849

For the `Homepage URL` option full in the web app base URL (e.g. `https://app.graphql-hive.com`).
For the `Authorization callback URL` option use the web app base URL followed by `/auth/callback/google` (e.g. `https://app.graphql-hive.com/auth/callback/google`)`.

Then, you need to add the following environment variables for your GraphQL Hive `app` instance:

```bash
AUTH_GOOGLE=1
AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=741784e6331a404eaXXX                         # use the one of your app
AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=e43e123dd54de2b56126dc4afc4491dbbba6bXXX # use the you just created
```

Now the Sign Up with GitHub button should be visible on the login page.

## Okta

First, you need to create a new Okta OIDC application within your admin dashboard.

For the `Sign-in redirect URIs` option full in the web app base url followed by `/auth/callback/okta` (e.g. `https://app.graphql-hive.com/auth/callback/okta`).

For the `Sign-out redirect URIs` option full in the web app base url followed by `/auth/logout` (e.g. `https://app.graphql-hive.com/logout`).

For the `Trusted Origins` option full in the web app base url (e.g. `https://app.graphql-hive.com`).

Afterwards, open the `General` tab of the created app and adjust the `General settings` as follows:

In the `LOGIN` section, set the `Login initiated by` field to `Euther Okta or App`.
In the `LOGIN` section, set the `Application visibility` field to `Display application icon to users`.
In the `LOGIN` section, set the `Login flow` field to `Redirect to app to initiate login (OIDC Compliant)`.
In the `LOGIN` section, set the `Login Initiate login URI` field to the web app base url followed by `/auth?provider=okta` (e.g. `https://app.graphql-hive.com/auth?provider=okta`).

Last, switch over to the `Okta API Scopes` tab and grant access to the `okta.users.read.self` scope.

![Application general settings](../../public/docs/pages/self-hosting/oidc-login/okta-okta-api-scopes.png)

Then, you need to add the following environment variables for your GraphQL Hive `app` instance:

```bash
AUTH_OKTA=1
# set to 1 if you want to hide the login button and only allow login via the Okta dashboard link
AUTH_OKTA_HIDDEN=0
# your org url (not the admin one)
AUTH_OKTA_ENDPOINT=https://dev-1234566789.okta.com
# client id of the application you just created
AUTH_OKTA_CLIENT_ID=0XXXwXXXX6fEpeXXXXXX
# client secret of the application you just created
AUTH_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=JhW3jf2hXXXP3rXXXiRyhtaXXXXX-aGicEtXXXXX
```

You should now be able to log into Hive using the Okta dashboard link of your created application.
The Login with Okta button should be visible on the login page - dependent on whether you set `AUTH_OKTA_HIDDEN` to `0` or `1`.
