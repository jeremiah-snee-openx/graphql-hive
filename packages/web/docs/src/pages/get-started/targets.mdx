# Targets

Once you have created a project, you will land up in the project home page showing you a dashboard with various options.

The next step you would typically want to do here is start with a target (which is askin to your environment for the project). For instance, in case you have the same project / service used across 3 environments (development, staging and production), you might want to create 3 targets to work with.

We create an `experiment` target by default to make it easier for you to get started.

You can use the "New Target" button and get your target created within the respective project.
