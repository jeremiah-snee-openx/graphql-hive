# Schema and its History

Once you have pushed the schema, you will find the schema you have pushed in Hive against the respective target as seen below

You will also start seeing every commit you have made in the History option in the sidebar.

Think of this like a Git diff / commit log but for GraphQL schema specifically.

This will also help you understand possible breaking changes you have made to your schema over the course of time.
