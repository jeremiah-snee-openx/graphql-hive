# Managing Tokens

Before you can start using Hive, the next step would be to generate a token against the target so that the same can be used to authenticate against the registry and do all the operations like pushing the schema, persisted operations, etc. from the client.

To do this, get into **Settings** (available in the sidebar of the target dashboard) and get into the Token section.

Enter a name for your token, decide on permissions and submit.

Once you click on Create, you will get a token generated by Hive. Copy it and keep it safe because this would be the token which would be used to push anything to this specific target or the project for all the commands you run.

If you ever forget a token, you can always regenerate a new one or revoke the existing ones as long as the relevant clients are updated with the same.
